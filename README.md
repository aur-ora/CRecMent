# CRecMent
The project was carried out during the Cybersecurity Seminars course. \
The main goal was to find a new innovative idea based on one of the seminars followed during the course. 
The solution proposed in this report is based on blockchain technology. \
A summary of the project described in the report follows:
There are different problems that governments have to handle when dealing with the maintenance and usability of criminal records. \
In this approach, the main change is to go from a traditional infrastructure that is client-server, to a blockchain infrastructure that is decentralized. 
The Blockchain is a system in which the data is not stored in a central data storage system, such as in databases, but multiple nodes have their own local view of the data. \
The solution proposed is aimed at simplifying the processes and the data sharing involved in criminal-records-related activities. Since there are a lot of parties involved (government organizations, courts, individuals, police stations, airports, etc.), there is no desire to add an additional layer of complexity that would make the management unbearable. \
The solution will simplify the heavy or analog processes, making it conceivable to automate different elements (wherever possible) and to reduce the time required to share information: there would be no need to use emails, paper documents, hand signatures, and certificates in the offices. This change will also decrease the error rate due to human mistakes. \
In order to achieve this goal, the key is to provide a simple but effective user interface that can be used from different devices.
By using Blockchain technology, the goal is two avoid two problems that arise in the traditional process: the handling of data security and data integrity.
Databases have vulnerabilities, so if used in the wrong way by an application, it could cause serious damage, e.g. they could be exploited through SQL injections, making an attacker read, delete, or update some criminal records. \
Given that systems underneath criminal records are crucial, it cannot be denied that they are already built with security in mind, so it is clearly a little bit harder (but not impossible) to tamper with the data they contain from the outside. \
Nevertheless, they still use databases to keep that data, so using a Blockchain-based infrastructure removes those issues. \
In addition, an administrator could have (or not) permission to delete data from the system, with the Blockchain infrastructure, that modification cannot be made unnoticed, considering that each block in the chain contains its own hash and the hash of the previous block, so if one of these gets modified, the hash wouldnâ€™t match anymore.
