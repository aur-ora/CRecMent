# CRecMent
The project was carried out during the Cybersecurity Seminars course. \
The main goal was to find a new innovative idea based on one of the seminars followed during the course. \
The topic chosen is Blockchain technology. \
The purpose of the solution described is to solve two main problems that arise when using traditional technology, such as databases, for keeping criminal records: the handling of data security and integrity. \
As said before, the solution given is based on the use of a Blockchain infrastructure that should make the management and maintenance of that kind of data more reliable.
